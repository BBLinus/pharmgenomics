We report the global distribution of pharmacogenetic variants whose impact on psychotropic drugs have been supported by clinical evidence in some populations. This study provides the allele frequency estimation for subpopulations/ethnic groups within major populations of the world. We also compute estimates of differential prevalence ratios of pharmacogenetic variants between a population of interest and other groups.
