Oligonucleotide primers flanking the 5-HTTLPR and corresponding to the nucleotide positions -1416 to -1397 (5-GGCGTTGCCGCTCTGAATTGC) and from -910 to -889 (5-GAGGGACTGAGCTGGACAACCCAC) of the SLC6A4 gene regulatory region were used to generate a 484(short)/528(long) bp fragment based on ref.8929413, 8632190. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the plasma concentrations of paroxetine, 5-HTTLPR genotype, and -1019C/G HTR1A gene polymorphism were significant factors affecting clinical response to paroxetine (reduction ratio of PAS score) at 2 weeks after the initiation of pharmacotherapy.

By contrast, none of the 29 EMs treated with nortriptyline became PMs.Patients are phenotyped with Debrisoquine (DBQ). DBQ metabolic ratio (DBQ/4-OH DBQ) greater than or equal to 12.6 defines PM status for this enzyme. Recovery Ratio (RR = 4-OH DBQ/DBQ+4-OH DBQ) is a transformation that linearizes the extremely wide range of DBQ metabolic ratio values in the EM population. A cut-off of 0.12 in RR differentiates EMs from PMs. RR was determine at baseline, before treatment with 20 mg paroxetine (inpatients) 10 mg/day (outpatients) was started. Paroxetine doses were increased to 20 mg after 1 week in outpatients and to 30 mg after 5 weeks in patients who still had a HAM-D score of 15 or greater. 35 received paroxetine (phenotypic PM-3, EM-32). decrease in RR associated with paroxetine was significantly greater (median change, 85.71%) than the decrease associated with nortriptyline (N=31).	paroxetine
