However, at low doses of haloperidol (<10mg/day), plasma concentrations of reduced haloperidol (RHAL) were significantly associated with the *10 allele (P<.005).	haloperidol

Patients were also genotyped for the presence of CYP2D6 *3 and *4 alleles, but the patient cohort, as defined in two previous papers (PMID: 9352580 & 10096261), did not show any subjects carrying those alleles. This study also split patients into gender groups. In both male and female patients, those carrying a variant allele showed significantly higher plasma concentrations of both haloperidol and reduced haloperidol as compared to patients with the wildtype genotype. In male patients only, carriers of a variant allele showed significantly higher plasma concentrations of prolactin as compared to those with the wildtype genotype.	haloperidol

Response assessed by Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) score after 1 month of treatment. Patients with the G-A haplotype had a greater decrease in PANSS score compared to those with the A-G haplotype. Statistical significance was set at 0.008 using the false discovery method (FDR).

When stratified for dose, this association was seen only in patients receiving less than 20mg/day (P=.003). In patients receiving 20mg/day or more, the association with CYP2D6 genotype no longer existed (P=.667). No association was seen between CYP2D6 genotype and plasma concentration:dose ratios of reduced haloperidol. CYP2D6*5 alleles were not included in statistical analysis due to low sample size.	haloperidol

Toxicity index was the area-under-curve (AUC) of the combined toxicity measures for days 0, 1, 3 and 7, where the toxicities measured were parkinsonoid toxicity, dyskinesia and akathesia. More specifically, patients with the CT genotype had an increased composite toxicity index of all three symptoms (parkinsonoid, dyskinesia and akathesia) at day 1, 3 and 7 of treatment, as compared to those with the CC genotype. Patients were treated with haloperidol monotherapy for 1 month during the acute phase of their psychotic illness.	haloperidol

None of the three variants were associated with increased risk of weight gain when studied alone.  When studied as a combination, only one combination, the long-C-Ser (repeat-rs3813929-rs6318), was associated with a protective effect against weight gain.  However, effect and sample sizes were small (n=13).

Patients were also genotyped for the presence of CYP2D6 *3 and *4 alleles, but the patient cohort, as defined in two previous papers (PMID: 9352580 & 10096261), did not show any subjects carrying those alleles. This study also split patients into gender groups. In both male and female patients, those carrying a variant allele showed significantly higher plasma concentrations of both haloperidol and reduced haloperidol as compared to patients with the wildtype genotype. In male patients only, carriers of a variant allele showed significantly higher plasma concentrations of prolactin as compared to those with the wildtype genotype.	haloperidol

No association between genotype alone or smoker status alone with haloperidol concentration was seen. Patients who smoked and had the *10/*10 genotype had significantly higher concentration/dose ratios than those who did not smoke. However, smokers without the *10/*10 genotype had significantly lower concentration/dose ratios than those who did not smoke. The effect of smoking on haloperidol metabolism depends on CYP2D6 genotype.	haloperidol
