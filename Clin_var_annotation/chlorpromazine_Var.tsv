The CC genotype was associated with an improved response compared to CT, which was also associated with an improved response compared to TT. The CG haplotype of rs1415744 and rs702304 was associated with improvement on the negative symptom scale (p=0.02).	chlorpromazine; clozapine; haloperidol; olanzapine; quetiapine; risperidone; trifluoperazine

In initial evaluation of whole cohort (men and women) authors stated ""A
significantly higher mean score was also found in those having MTHFR CT genotype compared with CC and TT
patients.
