1183688829	CYP2C19*1; CYP2C19*2; CYP2C19*3	PMID:16338280	CYP2C19	CYP2C19 *2 + *3 is associated with decreased metabolism of diazepam as compared to CYP2C19 *1.	yes	< 0.001	63		East Asian	Metabolism/PK,Other	false	Subjects were treated with diazepam to reduce preoperative anxiety. Subjects were classified as extensive metabolizers (*1/*1 genotype), intermediate metabolizers (*1/*2 or *1/*3 genotype), and poor metabolizers (*2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3 genotype, though no subjects with the *3/*3 genotype were found in this study). Poor metabolizers showed significantly increased diazepam AUC and decreased diazepam clearance as compared to extensive metabolizers. Poor metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers also showed significantly longer time to emerge from anesthesia as compared to extensive metabolizers.	diazepam
