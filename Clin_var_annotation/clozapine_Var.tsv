It was significantly associated with fasting trigylyceride levels (CC>CT>TT). The authors suggest that this variant enhances triglyceride accumulation and confers susceptibility to clozapine-induced metabolic syndrome. Additionally, expression of C3 mRNA in patients with metabolic syndrome was significantly higher as compared to those without metabolic syndrome (p=0.02), and this variant was associated with C3 expression in liver tissue (p=0.002). Lastly, when 105 patients' medical records were reviewed, patients with the C allele had a greater percentage change of triglyceride levels during a 2-year clozapine treatment (p=0.001).
