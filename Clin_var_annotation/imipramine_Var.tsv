No statistic given, but none of the ratios separated the two phenotypes (EM vs PM) completely.	imipramine

Dose was adjusted to a predefined plasma levels imi+desipramine 200-300 microg/l. Steady state was defined as unchanged dose of imipramine for at least 12 consecutive days. Patients carrying one or more loss-of-function allele vs patients carrying two functional alleles were compared. Patients receiving CYP inhibiting co-medication were not included.	imipramine
